This is the repo for our CVPR2024 paper "Training Vision Transformers for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation".

Thank you for your interest in our project. I would like to inform you that our code is currently under patent review, so we are unable to open source it at this time. However, I have already provided assistance about the code implementation and details to many individuals who have reached out, and I am more than happy to continue helping. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need further information.

Thank you for your understanding and support!
